    "In this project I want to discover if there is a visual correlation of the distribution of the major religions across all countries in the world and the occurrence of different kind of venues in each countries capital. \n",
    "\n",
    "In my opinion there should be strong differences in the kind of venues in different parts of the world. This should be strongly affected by cultural aspects. Since the religious distribution and also the absence of religion should have an impact on the culture, I want to look at the mutual influence between these factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis can also be interesting for people that want to open a new venue in an unknown city. They could easily grab religious distributions and plan the type of venue according to the historical data of successful venues depending on religions.\n"

    "In order to get a deep insight into the cultural characteristics of each country I want to look at the venues in each coutries capital. For this I grab the 100 most important venues in a 5km range around the capital city centre from Foursquare (www.foursquare.com). I will then extract the venue category from the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the comparision with religious distribution I will extract the data from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religions_by_country. The data will be cleaned and only the countries, their populations and each religion percentage will be selected.\n",
